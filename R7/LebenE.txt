She was born into a family, who funded their livelyhood by running a company for transporting grand pianos in +HWIEN+Vienna+. Consequently, 
after a few years in school and a short spell in an health insurance company she joined the family business. First she just worked in the office, 
but it did not take long, before she took a driving test for heavy goods vehicles and became driver and leader of one of the transportation crews. 
Whilst the male workmen carried the grand pianos, she carried the piano legs.
She was very much engaged in Scouting, where she met her future *R6*husband* in 1966. They married 3 years later and she gave birth to her first *r3*child* in 1970, 
almost whilst still driving lorries. Shortly after their *r1806*son* was born, she followed her *R6*husband* to his job in England with the rest of the family. 
They settled in +HPOOLE+Poole+ on the southern coast. After a few years of being housewife she helped her husband to establish their computer company, where 
she was Financial Director. Again, she engaged in youth work by being Akela for St. Peter's cub pack. She was famous for throwing fantastic parties 
for their friends and neighbours in their house in Wedgwood Drive. Unfortunately, in the late Eighties their business collapsed and - since her 
husband had already left the country to take up a job in Germany - she had the sad duty to sell all their possessions and drop the key of their 
lovely house onto the desk of the bank manager. She and her *R1806*son* followed *R6*Karl* to +HMUENCHE+Munich+, whilst her *r3*daughter* stayed back and married *r2*Joe* - a local boy.
She and her family lived in the heart of +HMUENCHE+Munich+ for a few years before she came seriousely ill. She suffered her illness very bravely, but in the 
end it got the better of her, and she died a few days after her 50th birthday with her *r6*husband* by her bedside in 1997.

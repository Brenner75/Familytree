He attended first school in Pettendorf and went to Grammar school in Stockerau until 1929, after which he began to study Geography and History at the University of Vienna.
But since his father had died very early there was not enough money in the family to pay for his studies and he had to give it up and take a job in a government office, 
where he earned 120 Schillings a month (about 10 Pounds in today's money) and started to climb the carreer ladder until the war started and he was conscripted in 1939, 
shortly after he had married and had  fathered his daughter. During the war he became financial resource manager for the supply chain to the various fronts in Poland, the Netherlands,
Belgium, France, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece. In 1941 he was caught and sent to war prison in Russia in a cattle wagon. For 3 days the train was parked in 
Deutsch-Wagram, only a short distance from where his family lived at this time. He smuggled a note out of his waggon saying: "I am here, but where is my family?" 
He was imprisoned in the Ukraine but a cow hit him on the shin so badly that he was released and returned home in 1943. He loved cows ever since.
In 1949 he accidentally fathered his second child and was not pleased about it. In the Fifties he moved to Vienna with his family and became a fairly high goverment 
officer managing some 80 people in the controlling department. After his retirement he moved back to Deutsch-Wagram where he tended the garden enthusiastically until his death.
All his life he had been a brilliant piano player.

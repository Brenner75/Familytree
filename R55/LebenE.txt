Emilia was the oldest child and had to look after her four elder - and rather lively brothers.
As a young girl she worked in the pub of her parents and gave generous credit to all students frequenting the place.
Several students fancied her (amongst them Karl Dorrek, who - being rejected by her, adopted her grand daughter some years later) 
but in the end she found her future husband Albrecht Mock.
She was such a good soul and looked after everthing and everybody. Regularly she visited her brother, who run a mountain hut in the Alps and brought him the best cuts of beef and soured cream.
Her brothers really took advantage of her, so when her mother had died, she sent a telegram to all of them saying: mother dead, me too.
Also, she told the facts of life to her great-granddaughter, who she shared a bedroom with, but made sure that she fell asleep, when the subject became too intimate.
When she was 82 she fell down some steps and broke her hip - which was nearly a death sentenhce in those days, since the patients hardly regained the strength to walk again. 
Her daughter Alice, however, forced her to push the pram with her new born son through the garden for hours on end. She fully recovered and led a healthy life for another 
five years and had a very soft spot for her great grandchild Karl, who had saved her life.

There is a bit of confusion about the spelling of his forename Karl, which is spelled with a C on his birth certificate, but with a K on his death announcement. Not a lot is known about him, 
apart from the fact, that he was a milk trader in the vicinity of +oGAISRUC+Gaisruck+ and he used to distribute the milk with a horse cart. Although the horse was totally blind, it nevertheless found its 
way for its daily round without help. During the summer months of 1920 he suddenly fell ill with an ear infection. He was only 38 years old and had to be taken to hospital. 
Before he left, he walked through his house and his garden and said to his 10 year old *r12*son*, that he knew, that he would never come back again. 
The infection spread to his brain and killed him shortly afterwards.

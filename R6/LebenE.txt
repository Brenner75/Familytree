The first 5 years of his life he spent in +HDEUTSCH+Deutsch-Wagram+ in a very female-dominated environment together with his *R54*great grandmother*, his *R27*grandmother*, his *R13*mother* and his *R1801*sister*. *R12*father* was only present in the evenings.
He visited first school in +HWIEN+Vienna+ where his way to school led him straight through St. Stephens cathedral. He took his A-levels in the Grammer School in the district of Favoriten in +HWIEN+Vienna+ early in year 1967.
Ha spent a year in the Austrian Army and volunteered to become an Officer of the reserve. After that he began to study Physics at the University of Vienna and concluded his study with an PhD in 1974. At this time he was already married
to his wife *R7*Francesca* - who he had met at Scouts - and had already a four year old *R3*daughter* and a three month old *R1806*son*. 
IN 1975 the whole family emigrated to England and settled down in +HPOOLE+Poole+, a seaside town on the southern coast. He worked briefly on an international project at the UKAEA, later on at HTMP - a research team - and finally established 
his own company together with his wife to produce computer programs. THe whole family was actively engaged in Scouting and would have stayed in England for ever if it had not been for the economic crises during
the late Thatcher years, which led to the collaps of hhis company. He lost everything including their house and their cars and all their money and had to leave England as an economic refugee. 
Only his *R3*daughter* stayed behinds and married *R2*Joe* - who she had met at Scouts, of course. Together they produced three lovely grandchildren for him.
He settled in +HMUENCHE+Munich+ and was employed by a company called IBB. Shortly after that he sadly lost his *r7*wife*, who died of lung cancer. In the mid-Nineties he took over the company, he worked with, due to the accidental death of his boss.
He managed the company as a Director until his retirement in 2015.
Since then he lives in +HWEICHS+Weichs+ near Munich, has a weekend relationship with *R2004*Ulrike Gödel*, renovates oldtimers, writes computer games and generally enjoys life, in particular since he had survived 2 serious cancer 
operations in 2015.

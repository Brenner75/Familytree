Not a lot is known about her early life, but after the untimely death of her husband (she was a widow when she was 36 years old), she ran a milk shop in the 6th district of Vienna.
She was a very proud woman and the saying goes, that she only greeted her customers when they entered her shop but never, when she walked the streets and met one of them.
She was a stout woman with interesting green eyes and loved to wear a fox skin, which was made in such a way, that the foxe's jaw could bite his own tail in order to stay 
properly in place  around the proud woman's neck. She had no gloves, but a 'Muff', which was basically a big fur tube with openings each end for the hands.
She had quite a noticable moustache, which she used to burn off with a candle before she met up with a very elusive character, called Mr. Brillinger, who was obviousely 
her partner but somehow never wanted to admit to it. 
During her later years she suffered from very heavy diabetes, which had caused an open wound on her leg, which refused to heal and finally led to her death.
